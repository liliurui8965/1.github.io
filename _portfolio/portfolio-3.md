Direct recycling process is by far the most environmental friendly recycling approach with the highest material recovery rate. The automated disassembly attempt as well as the cathode coating separation study both serve as the pretreatment steps for the direct recycling process which requires pure cathode coating as the raw material for the re-synthesis of new battery-grid cathode powder. Processes such as heat sintering, co-precipitation, and sol-gel are major resynthesize methods, among which the heat sintering method involves the direct solid-phase calcination is suitable for treating EoL cathode materials with simple elemental composition like LCO and LFP. This study focuses on the regeneration of EoL LFP utilizing the heat sintering method. Samples sintered under different temperature and atmosphere are first characterized by SEM and XRD. The rate performance of the regenerated samples are then tested in the form of coin cells utilizing lithium chips as the counter electrodes.
