The first part of study has identified sonicating time, sheet size, and solid-liquid weight ratio as three essential control factors towards the efficiency of the pre-treatment process, particularly the organic solvent step in LCO coating separation. DMAC outperformed DMF and proved to be the most cost effective organic solvent with the highest efficiency for the task. The S/N ratio analysis in Taguchi DOE revealed the contribution of sonicating time (86.55%), sheet size (7.44%), and sheet size (4.90%) towards the final yield. The mathematical relationship between the yield and control factors were successfully established with the result of Taguchi DOE and proved accurate by confirmation tests. The developed linear regression model provide a reference in choosing the proper control factors/independent variables with satisfying accuracy for the future industrial scale production.

The intact LFP coating separation process studied in the second part offered a great opportunity in achieving 100% LFP active material reclaiming with minimum process complexity for industrial-scale recycling of EoL LFP batteries. Compared to the traditional organic solvent extraction process assisted by the ultrasonic bath, the single step soaking process can save much effort in liquid-powder separation and organic solvent reclaim. The success in the development of the LFP separation yield regression model is closely related to volume expansion of the LFP cathode coating material, though the mechanism behind this phenomenon requires further study.
