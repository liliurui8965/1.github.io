The tiny vehicle as shown in the video is a purely mechanical system that is driven by gravitational potential energy of a weight. The core of the steering system is a carefully designed inner cam which enables the vehicle repeat the same path in each lap. A demonstration of how this mechanical system performs is as shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0LRw2XKFY0&t=19s)
