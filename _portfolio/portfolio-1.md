As governments have begun to set timetables for banning the production of internal combustion engine vehicles globally, the estimated annual demand for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) from electric vehicles (EVs) in 2025 reaches 408GWh, while this number was merely 20GWh in 2016.172 Previous studies on cycling performance degradation of battery packs in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) indicate a battery pack lifetime of only 4.5 to 14.5 years depending on their operating conditions. The foreseeing rapid growth of discarded LIB packs from HEVs and EVs along with an increasing number of end-of-life LIBs generated by portable electronics and energy storage plants will cause severe environmental and safety problems if not treated properly. Meanwhile, the end-of-life LIBs is a potential resource of valuable metals (e.g. Ni, Mn, Li or Co) while pressures have been imposed on the supply chain of these materials already.175 Therefore, it is of vital importance to develop recycling methodologies that are ecologically friendly and economically feasible for end-of-life LIBs in present time and future.

*Battery Material produt life cycle*

This automatic disassembly system is designed and prototyped specifically for dismantling and separating cathode sheets, anode sheets, separators, and Al laminated film housing from lithium-ion pouch cells. Compared to the destructive crushing strategy that has been widely adopted in industry, this proposed system has a great potential to achieve higher coating material recovery rate as well as yield purer cathode powder for mechanical pretreatment processes in mass production. I am in the charging position of every aspect of this project including concept design, apparatus (Fixture, Transporter, and Endeffector) design, machinery assemlby, electromechanical system development, and LabVIEW control UI development. Apart from securing a few publications and patent, this project also supported a local start-up company.
